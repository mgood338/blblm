Description: Uses the bag of little bootstraps algorithm to compute the
    the linear regression and logistic regression model. It is more computationally efficient since
    it uses both bootstrap and subsampling. It splits the data, computes the
    estimates, computes the regression estimates for a bag of little bootstraps 
    dataset, along with computing the coefficient, sigma, and confidence intervals
    for the fit.
